# Landing Page Basic
This is a simple landing page, built from scratch, using popular modern styling.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

Starting with a mobile first mindet, this simple landing page was built to keep everything in the center of the viewport. Images are not too large and there is a collapsible menu in the top right. 

## Optimizations

It's very easy to add too much to a website so I wanted to keep this simple. I used only a few colors (navy, white, black and gray) and only 3 images. I wanted this page to load quickly.


## Lessons Learned:

This project **started** as practice trying to simplify the collapsible menu icon (hamburger) that is in the top right. So many examples onlie require a lot of code and I wanted to hone it in a bit. It evolved into an enitre webpage. I got a lot of extra practice with flexbox and inheritance with this project because I tried to avoid using Id's as much as possible. Not a single !Important is used in this project either.

## Examples:
